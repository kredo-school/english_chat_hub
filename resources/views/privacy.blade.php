            <br>security, ensure consistency, and make the practices easy for users to understand.
            <br>Data practices should meet the reasonable expectations of users.
            <br>Information We Collect
            <br>We collect information in multiple ways, including when you provide information directly to us;
            <br>when we passively collect information from you, such as from your browser or device; and from
            <br>third parties.
            <br>Information You Provide Directly to Us
            <br>We will collect any information you provide to us. We may collect information from you in a
            <br>variety of ways, such as when you: (a) create an online account, (b) make a donation or purchase,
            <br>(c) contact us or provide feedback, (d) subscribe to our newsletter, or (e) subscribe to our
            <br>newsletter. This information may include but is not limited to your name, email address, phone
            <br>number, mailing address, payment information and your geographic location.
            <br>Information that Is Automatically Collected
            <br>Device/Usage Information
            <br>We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile
            <br>devices or tablets) you use to access the Services. As described further below, we may collect and
            <br>analyze (a) device information such as IP addresses, location information (by country and city),
            <br>unique device identifiers, IMEI and TCP/IP address, browser types, browser language, operating
            <br>system, mobile device carrier information, and (b) information related to the ways in which you
            <br>interact with the Services, such as referring and exit web pages and URLs, platform type, the
            <br>number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed and the order of those
            <br>pages, statistical information about the use of the Services, the amount of time spent on particular
            <br>pages, the date and time you used the Services, the frequency of your use of the Services, error
            <br>logs, and other similar information. As described further below, we may use third-party analytics
            <br>providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information.
            <br>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
            <br>We also collect data about your use of the Services through the use of Internet server logs and
            <br>online tracking technologies, like cookies and/or tracking pixels. A web server log is a file where
            <br>website activity is stored. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer when you
            <br>visit a website, that enables us to: (a) recognize your computer; (b) store your preferences and
            <br>settings; (c) understand the web pages of the Services you have visited and the referral sites that
            <br>have led you to our Services; (d) enhance your user experience by delivering content specific to
            <br>your inferred interests; (e) perform searches and analytics; and (f) assist with security
            <br>administrative functions. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are
            <br>tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and
            <br>that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, measure popularity of
            <br>the Services and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. We may also use tracking
            <br>technologies in our license buttons and/or icons that you can embed on other sites/services to track
            <br>the website addresses where they are embedded, gauge user interaction with them, and determine
            <br>the number of unique viewers of them. If you receive email from us (such as the CC newsletter,
            <br>campaign updates, or other ongoing email communications from CC), we may use certain
            <br>analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as whether you open our message, click on
            <br>any links or banners our email contains, or otherwise interact with what we send. This data allows
            <br>us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns. As we adopt
